Percolator is a minimal Solana program that wraps the `percolator` crate's `RiskEngine` inside a single on-chain **slab** account and exposes a small, composable instruction set for deploying and operating perpetual markets.

This README is intentionally **high-level**: it explains the trust model, account layout, operational flows, and the parts that are easy to get wrong (CPI binding, nonce discipline, oracle usage, and gating). It does **not** restate code structure or obvious Rust/Solana boilerplate.

## Concepts

### One market = one slab account
A market is represented by a single **program-owned** account (“slab”) containing:

- **Header**: magic/version/admin + reserved fields (nonce + threshold update slot)
- **MarketConfig**: mint/vault/oracle keys + policy knobs
- **RiskEngine**: stored in-place (zero-copy)

Benefits:
- one canonical state address per market (simple address model)
- deterministic, auditable layout
- easy snapshotting / archival
- minimizes CPI/state scattering

### Two trade paths
- **TradeNoCpi**: no external matcher; used for baseline integration, local testing, and deterministic program-test scenarios.
- **TradeCpi**: production path; calls an external matcher program (LP-chosen), validates the returned prefix, then executes the engine trade using the matcher’s `exec_price` / `exec_size`.

---

## Trust boundaries

Percolator enforces three layers with distinct responsibilities:

### 1) `RiskEngine` (trusted core)
- pure accounting + risk checks + state transitions
- **no CPI**
- **no token transfers**
- **no signature/ownership checks**
- relies on Solana transaction atomicity (if instruction fails, state changes revert)

### 2) Percolator program (trusted glue)
- validates account owners/keys and signers
- performs token transfers (vault deposit/withdraw)
- reads oracle prices
- runs optional matcher CPI for `TradeCpi`
- enforces wrapper-level policy (risk-reduction gating / auto-threshold)
- ensures coupling invariants (identity binding, nonce discipline, “use exec_size not requested size”)

### 3) Matcher program (LP-scoped trust)
- provides execution result (`exec_price`, `exec_size`) and “accept/reject/partial” flags
- trusted **only by the LP that registered it**, not by the protocol as a whole
- Percolator treats matcher as adversarial except for LP-chosen semantics and validates strict ABI constraints.

---

## Account model

### Slab account (market state)
- **Owner**: Percolator program id
- **Size**: fixed `SLAB_LEN`
- **Layout**: header + config + aligned `RiskEngine`

Reserved header fields are used for:
- **request nonce**: monotonic `u64` used to bind matcher responses to a specific request
- **last threshold update slot**: rate-limits auto-threshold updates

### Vault token account (market collateral)
- SPL Token account holding collateral for this market
- **Mint**: market collateral mint
- **Owner**: the vault authority PDA

Vault authority PDA:
- seeds: `["vault", slab_pubkey]`

### LP PDA (TradeCpi-only signer identity)
A per-LP PDA is used only as a CPI signer to the matcher.

LP PDA:
- seeds: `["lp", slab_pubkey, lp_idx_le]`
- required **shape constraints**:
  - system-owned
  - empty data
  - unfunded (0 lamports)

This makes it a “pure identity signer” and prevents it from becoming an attack surface.

### Matcher context (TradeCpi)
- account owned by matcher program
- matcher writes its return prefix into the first bytes
- Percolator reads and validates the prefix after CPI

---

## Instruction overview

This section describes intent and operational ordering, not argument-by-argument decoding.

### Market lifecycle
- **InitMarket**
  - initializes slab header/config + constructs `RiskEngine::new(risk_params)`
  - binds vault token account + oracle keys into config
  - initializes nonce + threshold update slot to zero
- **UpdateAdmin**
  - rotates admin key
  - setting admin to all-zeros “burns” governance permanently (admin ops disabled forever)
- **SetRiskThreshold**
  - manual override of `risk_reduction_threshold` (optional if auto-threshold is used)

### Participant lifecycle
- **InitUser**
  - adds a user entry to the engine and binds `owner = signer`
- **InitLP**
  - adds an LP entry, records `(matcher_program, matcher_context)`, binds `owner = signer`
- **DepositCollateral**
  - transfers collateral into vault; credits engine balance for that account
- **WithdrawCollateral**
  - performs oracle-read + engine checks; withdraws from vault via PDA signer; debits engine
- **CloseAccount**
  - settles and withdraws remaining funds (subject to engine rules)

### Risk / maintenance
- **KeeperCrank**
  - permissionless global maintenance entrypoint
  - accrues funding, charges maintenance fees, liquidates stale/unsafe accounts
  - optionally updates risk threshold via auto-threshold policy
- **LiquidateAtOracle**
  - explicit liquidation for a specific target at current oracle
- **TopUpInsurance**
  - transfers collateral into vault; credits insurance fund in engine

### Trading
- **TradeNoCpi**
  - trade without external matcher (used for testing / deterministic scenarios)
- **TradeCpi**
  - trade via LP-chosen matcher CPI with strict binding + validation

---

## Matcher CPI model

Percolator treats a matcher like a price/size oracle **with rules** chosen by the LP, but enforces a hard safety envelope.

### What Percolator enforces (non-negotiable)
- **Signer checks**: user and LP owner must sign
- **LP identity signer**: LP PDA is derived, not provided by the user
- **Matcher identity binding**: matcher program + context must equal what the LP registered
- **Matcher account shape**:
  - matcher program must be executable
  - context must not be executable
  - context owner must be matcher program
  - context length must be sufficient for the return prefix
- **Nonce binding**: response must echo the current request id derived from slab nonce
- **ABI validation**: strict validation of return prefix fields
- **Execution size discipline**: engine trade uses matcher’s `exec_size` (never the user’s requested size)

### What the matcher controls (LP-scoped)
- execution `price` and `size` (including partial fills)
- whether it rejects a trade
- any internal pricing logic, inventory logic, or matching behavior

### ABI validation principles
The matcher return is treated as adversarial input. It must:
- match ABI version
- set `VALID` flag
- not set `REJECTED` flag
- echo request identifiers and fields (LP account id, oracle price, req_id)
- have reserved/padding fields set to zero
- enforce size constraints (`|exec_size| <= |req_size|`, sign match when req_size != 0)
- handle `i128::MIN` safely via `unsigned_abs`/`unsigned_abs()` semantics (no `.abs()` panics)

## Risk-reduction gating and auto-threshold

### Why gating exists
When the system is under-insured, the wrapper can enforce “risk-reduction-only” trades to reduce griefing/DoS and protect the insurance fund from adversarial volatility.

### Activation condition
Gating is active when:
- `threshold > 0` **and**
- `insurance_balance <= threshold`

When active:
- **risk-increasing** trades are rejected
- risk-reducing trades are allowed

### Risk metric (wrapper-level)
Percolator computes a deterministic system risk metric from LP exposure:
- one O(n) scan to compute aggregate LP risk state
- O(1) delta check to decide whether a proposed LP delta increases risk
- conservative behavior when the max-position LP shrinks (overestimates risk rather than underestimates)

### Auto-threshold update (KeeperCrank)
Threshold can be updated by KeeperCrank (rate-limited + smoothed):
- update at most once per `THRESH_UPDATE_INTERVAL_SLOTS`
- compute target from risk units * oracle price
- apply EWMA smoothing
- apply step clamp to prevent sudden threshold jumps
- clamp to `[THRESH_MIN, THRESH_MAX]`

This policy is intentionally outside the engine so the engine remains a clean state machine.

## Operational runbook

### Who runs what?
- **Users / LPs**: init + deposits + trades
- **Keepers (permissionless)**: call `KeeperCrank` regularly
- **Admin**: may set threshold / rotate admin (unless burned)

### KeeperCrank cadence
Run `KeeperCrank` often enough to satisfy engine freshness rules:
- engine may enforce staleness bounds (e.g., `max_crank_staleness_slots`)
- in stressed markets, higher cadence reduces liquidation latency and funding drift

A typical ops approach:
- a keeper bot that calls `KeeperCrank` every N slots (or every M seconds) and retries on failure
- alerting on prolonged inability to crank (errors, oracle stale, account issues)

### Monitoring checklist
At minimum, monitor:
- insurance fund balance (and whether gating is active)
- total open interest / LP exposure concentration
- crank success rate + last successful crank slot
- oracle freshness (age vs max staleness) and confidence filter failures
- rejection rates for TradeCpi (ABI failures, identity mismatch, PDA mismatch)
- liquidation frequency spikes

### Governance / admin handling
- rotating admin changes who can:
  - set manual risk threshold
  - rotate admin again
- burning admin (setting to all zeros) is irreversible and disables admin ops forever

---

## Deployment flow

### Step 0: Create accounts off-chain
Create:
1) **Slab** account
   - owner: Percolator program id
   - size: `SLAB_LEN`
2) **Vault SPL token account**
   - mint: collateral mint
   - owner: vault authority PDA derived from `["vault", slab_pubkey]`

### Step 1: InitMarket
Call `InitMarket` with:
- admin signer
- slab (writable)
- mint + vault
- oracle pubkeys
- staleness/conf filter params
- `RiskParams` (warmup, margins, fees, liquidation knobs, crank staleness, etc.)

### Step 2: Onboard LPs and users
- LP:
  - deploy or choose matcher program
  - create matcher context account owned by matcher program
  - call `InitLP(matcher_program, matcher_context, fee_payment)`
  - deposit collateral
- User:
  - `InitUser(fee_payment)`
  - deposit collateral

### Step 3: Fund insurance
Call `TopUpInsurance` as needed.

### Step 4: Start keepers
Run `KeeperCrank` continuously.

### Step 5: Enable trading
- Use `TradeNoCpi` for local testing or deterministic environments
- Use `TradeCpi` for production execution via matcher CPI

## Security properties and verification

Percolator’s security model is “engine correctness + wrapper enforcement”.

### Wrapper-level properties (Kani-proven)
Kani harnesses are designed to prove program-level coupling invariants, including:

- matcher ABI validation rejects malformed/malicious returns
- owner/signer enforcement
- admin authorization + burned admin handling
- CPI identity binding (matcher program/context must match LP registration)
- matcher account shape validation
- PDA key mismatch rejection
- nonce monotonicity (unchanged on reject, +1 on accept)
- CPI uses `exec_size` (never requested size)
- i128 edge cases (`i128::MIN`) do not panic and are validated correctly

> Note: Kani does not model full CPI execution or internal engine accounting; it targets wrapper security properties and binding logic.

### Engine properties
Engine-specific invariants (conservation, warmup, liquidation properties, etc.) live in the `percolator` crate’s verification suite. The program relies on engine correctness but does not restate it.

## Admin Key Threat Model

Assume the admin key is compromised or adversarial. This section lists:
- what that key is intentionally trusted to do (and therefore can abuse),
- what it is **not** supposed to be able to do.

### What a malicious admin can do (by design / trust boundary)

These are governance powers, not bugs:

1. `UpdateAdmin`
   - rotate admin to attacker-controlled key or burn admin to zero.
   - impact: governance capture or permanent governance lockout.
2. `SetRiskThreshold`
   - force restrictive gating behavior.
   - impact: users may be unable to open/increase risk.
3. `UpdateConfig`
   - change funding/threshold policy knobs (within validation bounds).
   - impact: economics can become unfavorable to users.
4. `SetMaintenanceFee`
   - increase maintenance fee sharply.
   - impact: faster capital decay for open accounts.
5. `SetOracleAuthority` + `SetOraclePriceCap`
   - choose who can push authority price, and adjust cap behavior.
   - impact: price input control/censorship surface.
6. `ResolveMarket`
   - transition market to resolved mode using stored authority price.
   - impact: trading/deposits/new accounts are halted; market enters wind-down.
7. `WithdrawInsurance` (post-resolution, after positions are closed)
   - withdraw insurance buffer to admin ATA.
   - impact: no insurance backstop remains.
8. `AdminForceCloseAccount` (post-resolution only)
   - force-close abandoned accounts.
   - impact: users are forcibly settled/closed by admin action.
9. `KeeperCrank` with `allow_panic != 0`
   - admin-only panic crank path.
   - impact: emergency settlement behavior can be triggered.
10. `CloseSlab` (when market is fully empty)
    - decommission market account and recover slab lamports.
    - impact: market is permanently closed.

### What a malicious admin should NOT be able to do

These are intended hard boundaries enforced in code and test suites:

1. Cannot run admin ops without matching signer.
   - non-admin attempts fail (`EngineUnauthorized`).
   - covered by tests like `test_attack_admin_op_as_user`, `test_attack_resolve_market_non_admin`, `test_attack_withdraw_insurance_non_admin`.
2. Cannot use old admin key after rotation.
   - covered by `test_attack_old_admin_blocked_after_transfer`.
3. Cannot perform admin ops after admin is burned to `[0;32]`.
   - covered by `test_attack_burned_admin_cannot_act`, `test_attack_update_admin_to_zero_locks_out`.
4. Cannot push authority oracle prices unless signer == `oracle_authority`.
   - covered by `test_attack_oracle_authority_wrong_signer`.
5. Cannot resolve without an authority price, or resolve twice.
   - covered by `test_attack_resolve_market_without_oracle_price` and double-resolution tests.
6. Cannot withdraw insurance before resolution or while any account still has open position.
   - covered by `test_attack_withdraw_insurance_before_resolution`, `test_attack_withdraw_insurance_with_open_positions`.
7. Cannot mutate risk/oracle/fee config after resolution.
   - covered by `test_attack_set_oracle_authority_after_resolution_rejected`,
     `test_attack_set_oracle_price_cap_after_resolution_rejected`,
     `test_attack_set_maintenance_fee_after_resolution_rejected`,
     `test_attack_set_risk_threshold_after_resolution_rejected`.
8. Cannot force-close arbitrary active positions.
   - `AdminForceCloseAccount` requires resolved mode and zero position.
   - covered by `test_admin_force_close_account_requires_resolved` and `test_admin_force_close_account_requires_zero_position`.
9. Cannot redirect user close payouts to arbitrary token accounts in owner-gated paths.
   - user paths (`WithdrawCollateral`, `CloseAccount`) require owner signer and owner ATA checks.
   - `AdminForceCloseAccount` verifies destination ATA owner matches stored account owner.
10. Cannot close slab while funds/state remain (default build).
    - requires zero vault, zero insurance, zero used accounts, zero dust.
    - covered by tests like `test_attack_close_slab_with_insurance_remaining`,
      `test_attack_close_slab_with_vault_tokens`,
      `test_attack_close_slab_blocked_by_dormant_account`.

### Critical caveat

If compiled with feature `unsafe_close`, `CloseSlab` intentionally skips safety checks to reduce CU.
Do not enable `unsafe_close` in production builds.

---

## Failure modes and recovery

### Common rejection causes (TradeCpi)
- matcher identity mismatch (LP registered different program/context)
- bad matcher shape (non-executable program, executable ctx, wrong ctx owner, short ctx)
- LP PDA mismatch / wrong PDA shape
- ABI prefix invalid (flags, echoed fields, reserved bytes, size constraints)
- gating active + risk-increasing trade

These are expected and should be treated as **hard safety rejections**, not transient errors.

### Oracle failures
- stale price (age > max staleness)
- confidence too wide (conf filter)

Recovery:
- wait for oracle updates
- adjust market config (if governance allows)
- ensure keepers are running so freshness rules remain satisfied

### Admin burned
Once admin is burned (all zeros), admin ops are permanently disabled.
Recovery is “by design impossible” (this is a one-way governance lock).
