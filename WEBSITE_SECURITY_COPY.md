Safe Harbor
- If you follow this policy in good faith and avoid privacy violations, data destruction, or service disruption, we will not pursue legal action.

Testing Guidelines

- Do not publicly disclose the issue until we agree on timing.

Recognition / Bounties
- We may recognize valid reports in release notes. If we institute a formal bug bounty, details will be posted here.

Program Metadata (on-chain)
- We publish a solana-security-txt block in the Percolator program with these details, so explorers and researchers can discover our contact and policy.
